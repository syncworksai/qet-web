        Why I Teach — The Story Behind Quantum Edge FX
      </h2>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-neutral-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I’ve always had an eye for patterns. Working in banking, I was surrounded by investments every day—and the
          more I learned, the deeper my curiosity grew. Trading fascinated me because it combined logic, psychology,
          and performance under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my real education came when life hit hard. My baby was born a month early, our finances were tight, and
          I was trying to make trading work. In the process, I blew accounts. I made every mistake new traders make—but
          those losses taught me the one thing no chart ever will: you can’t force the market. Success only comes when
          your emotions are calm and your process is consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I passed a funded challenge, I realized there was still more to master—not in my charts, but
          in myself. A friend convinced me to post my trades publicly, just to hold myself accountable. What I didn’t
          expect was how many people it would help. Traders started reaching out, saying my breakdowns made things click
          for them. That’s when Quantum Edge FX was born—not just as an app, but as a movement built on structure,
          coaching, and accountability.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-100 mt-4">Why Quantum Edge Works</h3>
        <p>
          My strategy is simple, proven, and adaptable—it works in up, down, and sideways markets. But strategy alone
          doesn’t create success. Discipline does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum Edge FX was designed to combine structure and psychology—so traders learn to master themselves as
          much as their charts. Every indicator, every journal, every coaching session is built to help you become your
          own signal caller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our students’ first breakthroughs come fast: reading momentum more clearly, understanding the technical
          structure, recognizing levels, and executing with discipline. Then comes the real transformation—the emotional
          balance, the confidence to take trades calmly, and the consistency that only comes with true self-control.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-100 mt-4">What We Stand For</h3>
        <p>
          We’re not another signal group. We’re a training ground for independent, funded traders. In our first month,
          we funded seven accounts through our partner prop firms—and every one of those traders earned it through
          focus and discipline, not luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Quantum Edge, we believe anyone can learn this skill with the right guidance. You don’t need a degree or
          genius-level IQ. You just need the right structure, coaching, and belief in yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: To help everyday people understand trading, understand themselves, and grow into
          disciplined, confident, and self-reliant individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because trading doesn’t just teach you how to make money—it teaches you who you are. And when you learn to
          master your thoughts, you’ll master your actions… and your results will follow.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-100 mt-4">The Quantum Edge Community</h3>

          goal: consistent performance and personal evolution. When you finish our program, you won’t just understand
          the market—you’ll trust yourself in it. You’ll trade with confidence, poise, and patience. You’ll know that
